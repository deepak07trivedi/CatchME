## We all memorize the time when we were young kids and we didn't had the phones which we have in todays world . So the one game which i liked the most in my childhood was the snake game and wanted to compete with my friends in the game. So now it is possible i have learnt basics of java and tried creating a game 
## with this game one can play the game and the scores will bw recorded and the players can compete aming themselves.It has features like Login Signup Scoreboard etc.
## IT uses the techonlogies like JAVA, JAVAFX, JDBC and MYSQL.
